# Welcome to my Portfolio!
Welcome to my portfolio, where data meets insights, and numbers tell a story. I am excited to present a collection of my work that showcases my passion for unraveling the hidden patterns within data and transforming them into actionable insights. These works are a combination of school work as well as projects from my work experiences and internships. 

In this portfolio, you will find examples of my work demonstrating my data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and storytelling expertise. You will see how I have leveraged my knowledge in statistical analysis, data manipulation, and various data analysis tools to provide valuable insights to organizations. These projects not only highlight my technical proficiency but also reflect my ability to effectively bridging the gap between data and decision-makers.

This portfolio is a testament to my commitment to excellence in data analysis. It's a glimpse into my journey as a Data Scientist, and I'm eager to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to your organization's success. Feel free to explore the projects I've undertaken and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions (chelseynkim@gmail.com).

I've uploaded any work I've done in R as an html. If you would like to see the code and outputs, you'll have to download the project and view it in your browser.
